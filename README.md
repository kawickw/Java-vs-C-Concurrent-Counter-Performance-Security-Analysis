# Java-vs-C-Concurrent-Counter-Performance-Security-Analysis
A side-by-side analysis of Java and C++ implementations of a multithreaded counter. This project explores thread synchronization, memory management, and the performance/security trade-offs between high-level (Java) and low-level (C++) concurrency models.
